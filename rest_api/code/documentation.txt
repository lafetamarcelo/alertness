Alertness MOLI algorithm documentation ---------------------------------------*

The module is included with two main functions, one called "MOLIwhiteBox" res-
ponssible to determine the white box model parameters for a person alertness le-
vel, and a second that can be used to simulate a generic alertness level for a
generic person.

class MOLIwhiteBox(method::string):
'Expected to initialize the model structure as 'trivial', sets $\omega_c$ and
$tau_c$ as $\pi/12$ and $28.32$, respectivelly.'
    def

    def fit(samples::dict):
    'Expected to have a samples data such as:
          samples = {'time': time samples data [I],
                     'levAl': alertness time samples [II],
                     'windDecisions': time awake per day [III]}

    (I): is a list of numpy.array data, with length equal to the number of days
        of the collected data, with the time infomation of each sample.
    (II): is a list of numpy.array data, with length equal to the number of days
        of the collected data, with the alertness infomation of each sample.
    (III): is a list with the time awake of each day.'
