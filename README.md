# Alertness
Identification algorithm development for the alertness level simulator. The idea is to create a algorithm to identify the parameters for a white box model of the alertness level simulated person. The simulator considers the proposition that the alertness level of a person is composed by it's circadian and homeostatic level. So the objective is to identify the main parameters of both alertness compounds.

Therefore, the white box approach should be compared with a global optimization parameter tuning technique such as 'fminsearch', 'fmincon', 'annealing' and etc. By comparing the convergence ability of each one, and the consistency of results from the white box one.
